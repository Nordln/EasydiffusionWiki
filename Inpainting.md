**Inpainting** is a technique in which the AI draws only in a selected part of the initial image, while keeping other parts of the
initial image intact.

To use inpainting, first select an initial image using the `Browse` button, then click the `Inpaint` button. Then highlight the area (called a "mask") which the AI should draw into, and then press `Save`.

## Tips
* Larger masked areas work better than smaller areas.
* The initial image impacts the result. If you can't get good results, try to sketch the desired results using a simple paint program.
* The unmasked area will be slightly changed by the inpainting process. You can enable the `Strict Mask Border` checkbox (under the initial image) to prevent this.
