Easy Diffusion needs access to the GPU devices to use them for computations.
1. Check the owner of one of these devices:
    ```sh
    ls -al /dev/kfd
    ```
2. Determine the name of the group:
    ```
    crw-rw---- 1 root render 511, 0 Sep  3 11:31 /dev/kfd
                      ******
    ```
    In this example, the group owning the file is called `render`
3. Check whether your user is member of this group:
    ```sh
    groups
    ```
    If your user is already a member of the group, you're done.
4. If your user is not yet a member, add it to the group:
    ```sh
    sudo usermod -aG render $USER
    ```
    Replace `render` by the name of the group if it has a different name in your Linux distribution.
5. Log off and log on again to make this change effective.
