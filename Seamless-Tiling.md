**Seamless Tiling** refers to the technique of creating a visually continuous pattern that can be repeated indefinitely without any noticeable seams or borders between the tiles.

This is useful in making art for games, repeating backgrounds for posters and wallpapers.

With Easy Diffusion, you can create tiles which you can place next to themselves.

## How to use
Enable `Seamless Tiling` by choosing `Vertical`, or `Horizontal` or `Both` in the `Image Settings` panel:

There are three different tiling directions: "Horizontal", "Vertical" or "Both":

### Horizontal tiling
Place the generated image next to itself:

This mode is ideal for landscapes.

### Vertical tiling
Stack the generated image:

### Both directions
The images can tile the entire plane. Ideal for textures or wrapping paper:
