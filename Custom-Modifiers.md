This feature allows adding custom modifiers with sample images, instead of using just text values.

Inside your Easy Diffusion install folder, look for a `modifiers` folder -- create it if it does not exist. This is where you will copy your custom modifier images. To preserve the aspect ratio, generate your sample images at 512x512. If an image is directly inside of `modifiers` then it will be added to a Modifiers category. Images in direct subfolders will have the folder names as the category. Otherwise images in sub-sub folders, etc., will have the folder path be the category (ex: `modifiers/Foo/Bar` will become `Foo/Bar`). The original order of categories (defined in `modifiers.json`) is preserved, and new categories will be added at the end sorted alphabetically.

Rename your images to the actual text of the modifier prompt, followed by the type extension (such as `.png`). 

If the image ends in ` Portrait`, `.Portrait`, `-Portrait`, or `_Portrait` (case insensitive) it will be considered a portrait image, and if it has Landscape instead it would be a landscape image, and the portrait/landscape suffix will be removed from the modifier name. Otherwise the image will be used as both the portrait and landscape.

After adding your images and organizing your folders, restart the Easy Diffusion server in order for the images to finally appear.

Note that in Windows, you may run into a limitation on the size of your path/filename combination.
