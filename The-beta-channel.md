The beta version includes new features that we're working on. This gives you access to the latest features as they're being developed, often weeks before they're announced. But these new features may contain a few bugs, since they're still under development.

If you're using the beta version, and want to report any bugs (or feedback), please report them to `#beta` on our [discord community](https://discord.com/invite/u9yhsFmEkB).

# Leaving the beta program
You can return to the stable version by:
1. Disable the beta-channel checkbox in the Settings tab.
2. Press `Save`.
3. Restart Easy Diffusion.

If this is not possible (for e.g. if the beta version isn't starting any more), you can leave the beta program by editing the configuration manually:
1. In your installation directory (e.g. `C:\EasyDiffusion`), edit the `config.yaml` file using a text-editor (like Notepad).
2. Replace the word `beta` in that file by `main`. Press save.
3. Restart Easy Diffusion.
